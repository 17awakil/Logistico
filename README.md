# Logistico üõ†Ô∏è 
Your One-Stop-Shop for Everything Inventory and Logistics

[Go to Logistico](https://logistico-app.herokuapp.com/)

## About
Logistico was built for Shopify's Summer 2022 Backend Developer Intern Challenger! The app aims to help companies monitor and update their inventory to stay on top of their operations.

## Tech Stack
Logistico was developed using a ReactJS frontend, a NodeJS backend, and a MongoDB database. 

## Key Features
* Create an Inventory Item
* View an Inventory Item
* Edit an Inventory Item
* Delete an Inventory Item
* View all Inventory Items

## Special Feature: Upload Images and Store Images with Generated Thumbnails
Each inventory item has its associated inventory item image that can be uploaded by a Logistico employee. When the image is uploaded, a smaller image is created as a thumbnail of the image. This feature uses MongoDB's GridFS API, which allows users to upload files of unlimited size and stores the file in chunks.
